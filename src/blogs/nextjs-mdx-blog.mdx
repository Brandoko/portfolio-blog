## What we‚Äôre building üèóÔ∏è

This quick tutorial will walk you through how to create and deploy a blog website from start to finish. This tutorial assumes you have some light exposure to React and Markdown format, but requires no prior Next.js experience. The blog will be created using Next.js, and deployed through Vercel for a free, fast, and scalable solution. We'll be using MDX to write the blog posts. MDX is a markdown variant that allows you to write JSX code inside your markdown. You can even import custom React components into markdown to support things like interactive widgets in your blog.

The source code for the completed tutorial is available here: https://github.com/Brandoko/nextjs-mdx-blog-starter

## Getting Node if you don‚Äôt have it üíª

Next.js runs on Node.js. You need Node 16.8 or later as per the [Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation). Install the latest version of Node.js [from the official Node site](https://nodejs.org/en). It is recommended to download the latest LTS release for stability.

## Creating the Next.js app üßë‚Äçüíª

Use the following command to create the Next.js app: `npx create-next-app@latest`

- What is your project named? nextjs-mdx-blog-starter
- Would you like to use TypeScript with this project? Yes
- Would you like to use ESLint with this project? Yes
- Would you like to use Tailwind CSS with this project? Yes
  - We will be using the Tailwind prose plugin to style our entire blog post with one css class.
- Would you like to use `src/` directory with this project? Yes
- Use App Router (recommended)? Yes
- Would you like to customize the default import alias? No

After this short setup you can start your website locally

- Go into your newly created project `cd <your project name>`
- Run `npm run dev` and see your site update automatically as you make changes at http://localhost:3000

## Quick cleanup üßπ

Clear out the pre-made styles in `src/app/globals.css`. Your `globals.css` file should contain the only the following:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

## Creating a Page for rendering your blogs üìÑ

Let‚Äôs create a simple React component in `src/app/blogs/[slug]/page.tsx`:

```typescript
export default async function Blog({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{params.slug}</h1>
      <h2>my first section</h2>
      <p>some content</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

Visit http://localhost:3000/blogs/hello to see the see the unformatted text. Notice the first line is "hello" becuase of the url path param.

### About Next.js routing üöè

All pages go inside your `src/app/` folder and must have the name `page.tsx` for Next.js to recognize it as a page. Next.js uses file based routing, so if you put `page.tsx` in `src/app/hello/world`, then that page will be available at http://localhost:3000/hello/world.

## Create a layout for our blog page üç±

Our layout will render some HTML tags like main, nav, and article to structure our blog post page.

Our layout will also have a secret weapon, tailwind‚Äôs prose class. Tailwind‚Äôs prose will format semantic html tags like h1, h2, p, etc. into a clean layout that will make your blog look clean and professional.

Install the prose plugin

```
npm i @tailwindcss/typography
```

Add the plugin to the list of plugins in the `tailwind.config.js`. It should look like this afterwards:

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    // ...
  },
  plugins: [
    require("@tailwindcss/typography"),
    // ...
  ],
};
```

Now create a `layout.tsx` file in `src/app/blogs/[slug]`.

```typescript
import Link from "next/link";
import { ReactNode } from "react";

export default function BlogLayout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <main className="mx-auto min-h-screen max-w-3xl">
      <nav className="flex space-x-6 py-10">
        <Link href={"/"}>Home</Link>
      </nav>
      <article className="prose max-w-none">{children}</article>
    </main>
  );
}
```

Check your browser again, your blog post should be looking much better now.

## Adding blog posts üìÑ

It‚Äôs time to start creating some blogs. Create a `blogs` folder in `src/` and create `first-blog.mdx` inside.

`src/blogs/first-blog.mdx`:

```mdx

## Why I'm Building a Blog üë∑

As a developer, the decision to start a technical blog sprang from my constant desire for knowledge sharing and community building. Software development, in its essence, is not a solitary activity, but a deeply collaborative one. By developing a blog, I found a platform to reflect on my learnings, share tips and tricks, and, in turn, strengthen my understanding of complex concepts. It became my tech playground, a place where I could experiment with new ideas and tools, and express them in my own words.

### Personal and Community Growth üìà

Blogging also played a crucial role in my personal growth as a developer. It not only honed my ability to communicate technical ideas clearly but also improved my critical thinking skills. There's something incredibly fulfilling about transforming a nebulous concept into a structured, digestible piece of content. Ultimately, I see my blog as an open-source contribution to the dev community ‚Äî an attempt to give back, learn, grow, and inspire fellow developers on their journey.

MDX is just markdown with the ability to import JSX. We don‚Äôt have any JSX yet. The section at the top with the title and date is frontmatter metadata. This is a set of key/value pairs that let you define metadata about your markdown file. We will use the title and date when we display a list of all your blog posts.

We‚Äôre going to create a utility function that scans the `src/blogs/` folder for all mdx files and parses their content and frontmatter data.

In order to parse the frontmatter values from the mdx files, we need to install the `gray-matter` package.

```
npm i gray-matter
```

Then we can create a `get-blogs.ts` file in a utils folder that will contain a function that reads all the blogs.

`src/utils/get-blogs.ts`:

```typescript
import fs from "fs/promises";
import path from "path";
import matter from "gray-matter";

export const getBlogs = async () => {
  const blogsDir = "src/blogs";
  const files = await fs.readdir(blogsDir);

  return Promise.all(
    files
      .filter((fileName) => path.extname(fileName) === ".mdx")
      .map(async (blogFileName) => {
        const blogSlug = path.basename(blogFileName, ".mdx");
        const filePath = path.join(blogsDir, blogFileName);
        const blogMdx = await fs.readFile(filePath, "utf8");
        const fontmatter = matter(blogMdx);

        return {
          title: fontmatter.data.title,
          date: fontmatter.data.date,
          content: fontmatter.content,
          slug: blogSlug,
        };
      })
  );
};
```

The `getBlogs` function is using the async/await versions of the `fs` file system utilities. We create and await an array of promises, one for each mdx file. Each promise resolves with the parsed data from the MDX file. We are using `gray-matter` to read the title, date, and content. Finally we set slug as the name of the file. So if your file is called `first-blog.mdx` then the slug will be `first-blog`. We will use this slug to determine the url it is served at.

`getBlogs` will be used to show a list of all blogs on our site, and also to get the content of any particular blog.

We‚Äôre almost there, in order to render the MDX content we will use the `MDXRemote` component from `next-mdx-remote`. As the name suggests this will also open the door to rendering your MDX files from a remote repository, like a github profile or cloud storage bucket.

```
npm i next-mdx-remote
```

Let's head back to `src/app/blogs/[slug]/page.tsx` and replace it with the following code. We use `getBlogs` and `MDXRemote` to find the right blog for our given URL and render it.

`src/app/blogs/[slug]/page.tsx`:

```typescript
import { getBlogs } from "@/utils/get-blogs";
import { MDXRemote } from "next-mdx-remote/rsc";

export default async function Blog({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const blogs = await getBlogs();
  const currentBlog = blogs.find((blog) => blog.slug === params.slug);
  if (!currentBlog) return null;

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{currentBlog.title}</h1>
      <MDXRemote source={currentBlog.content} />
    </>
  );
}
```

Since we‚Äôre rendering this in a React server component we are importing the rsc version of `MDXRemote` from `"next-mdx-remote/rsc"`

### VSCode typescript quirk

If you see VSCode complaining about `'MDXRemote' cannot be used as a JSX component.`, that means VSCode is using a version of Typescript that doesn't understand server components. Press F1 and type `Typescript: Select TypeScript Version‚Ä¶`. Click into that and then choose the Workspace version of typescript. This uses Next.js' version of typescript.

Time to see the result of our work! Go to http://localhost:3000/blogs/first-blog and you should see your first-blog.mdx.

If you visit another route like /blogs/test you will get a blank page since there are no mdx files named test.mdx in our blogs folder. We will address this next.

## Making our blog posts statically generated üèéÔ∏è

Our blog site is working at a basic level, but we can make it faster! Right now everytime you visit your blog page Next.js is rendering the page on the server and sending it to the browser. Why are we rendering the blog post on every view if it only changes when we edit the MDX file? Instead let's render it once at build time.

Next.js has built in support to make this easy. If you export an async function called `generateStaticParams` from any `page.tsx` file then the return value of that function will tell Next.js about all the pages to render statically at build time for that page.

We will use our handy `getBlogs` helper again to tell Next about all of our blogs to render.

Add this export anywhere in `src/blogs/[slug]/page.tsx`:

```typescript
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const blogs = await getBlogs();

  return blogs.map((blog) => ({
    slug: blog.slug,
  }));
}
```

It returns a list of objects with a `slug` property. Each of these objects are passed to your `Blog` component at build time so that Next.js can render an instance of the page for each slug. This won‚Äôt change anything in dev mode. When you run npm run dev to start your dev server Next.js won‚Äôt statically build any pages.

Finally add this export anywhere in `src/app/blogs/[slug]/page.tsx` to tell Next.js that any page that was not statically built should return a 404 instead of trying to dynamically render:

```typescript
const dynamicParams = false;
export { dynamicParams };
```

### Seeing the difference static generation makes

If you curious to see static rendering in action and the renders it saves, add a console log inside your `Blog` component `` console.log(`Blog ${params.slug} is rendering`); ``

Now comment out your `generateStaticParams` function so that it won't run.

Run `npm run build` followed by `npm run start` to create and run a production build.

Finally visit your blog at http://localhost:3000/blog/first-blog and refresh the page a few times. Notice that in your terminal where you ran `npm run start` you‚Äôll see ‚ÄúBlog first-blog is rendering‚Äù every time you refresh the page.

Now uncomment `generateStaticParams` and save your file. Stop the server and run `npm run build` followed by `npm run start` again. Perform the same refresh test and notice that there are no console logs when you refresh! Your server doesn‚Äôt need to render the page on each visit since it was cached at build time.

## Making a homepage to list all of your blogs üìÑ

To wrap this simple blog site up, let‚Äôs make a homepage that renders every blog on the site with a link to it. This will be easy since we already have `getBlogs` to give us the metadata for every post.

Open the `src/app/page.tsx` file that was created for you at the start and clear out the file. We will use the `getBlogs` function so that we can render a link for every blog post.

`src/app/page.tsx`:

```typescript
import { getBlogs } from "@/utils/get-blogs";
import Link from "next/link";

export default async function Home() {
  const blogs = await getBlogs();

  return (
    <main>
      {blogs.map((blog) => (
        <Link key={blog.slug} href={`/blogs/${blog.slug}`}>
          {blog.title}
        </Link>
      ))}
    </main>
  );
}
```

We are rendering Next.js' `Link`component for each blog post. The href is set to `/blogs/{blog slug name}`.

You can now click the "Home" button above your blog post to go home and see all your blogs. Clicking your blog's title will bring you to the blog. The home page isn‚Äôt pretty looking yet, but it works!

Add another blog to the `src/blogs` folder, it can be whatever you want.

Now we can style up the home page a bit:

`src/app/page.tsx`:

```typescript
import { getBlogs } from "@/utils/get-blogs";
import Link from "next/link";

export default async function Home() {
  const blogs = await getBlogs();

  return (
    <main className="mx-auto mt-10 min-h-screen max-w-xl">
      <h1 className="mb-10 bg-gradient-to-r from-cyan-400 to-blue-700 bg-clip-text py-1 text-5xl font-black tracking-tight text-transparent">
        My Scalable Blog
      </h1>
      <ul className="space-y-4">
        {blogs.map((blog) => (
          <li key={blog.slug}>
            <Link
              href={`/blogs/${blog.slug}`}
              className="group flex flex-col rounded-lg border border-neutral-200 bg-neutral-50 p-4 hover:shadow-lg hover:shadow-neutral-100"
            >
              <h2 className="font-bold text-neutral-900 group-hover:underline">
                {blog.title}
              </h2>
              <p className="text-sm text-neutral-600">{blog.date}</p>
            </Link>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </main>
  );
}
```

Looking better! Try redesigning the page to put your own spin on it.
